# Ex.No-09-Building-a-Simple-AI-Agent-AI-Tourist-Guiide-for-India
## Aim : To design, implement and test a simple goal-based AI agent in Python that plans a personalised India trip itinerary for a tourist, based on the tourist's interest, trip duration and daily budget.
Introduction
An AI agent is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators in order to achieve a specific goal. A useful way to describe an agent is the PEAS framework — Performance measure, Environment, Actuators and Sensors. Agents are commonly classified as simple reflex agents (react only to the current input), goal-based agents (choose actions that achieve a defined goal) and utility-based agents (choose the action that maximises a measure of “goodness”). In this experiment, an AI Tourist Agent for India is built as a goal-based agent: given a tourist's goal (an enjoyable trip within their interest and budget), the agent perceives the tourist's preferences, reasons over a knowledge base of Indian destinations, plans a day-wise itinerary, and acts by presenting the recommended plan.
Procedure 
### Step 1: Import Required Libraries
●	textwrap – used only to neatly wrap long destination descriptions to a fixed line width while printing the itinerary.

### Step 2: Define the Agent's Knowledge Base (Destination Database)
●	The agent's environment knowledge is stored as a list of dictionaries, one per Indian destination.
●	Each destination has a category (heritage, spiritual, beach, hill_station, adventure, nature, wildlife), an estimated cost per day, the best travel season and a short description.
●	This knowledge base plays the same role for the agent that the environment model plays for any goal-based agent — it is what the agent reasons over to choose its actions.

Destination Knowledge Base Summary
The table below summarises the destinations available to the agent:

### Step 3: Perceive — Read the Tourist's Goal / Preferences
●	The perceive() function represents the agent's sensors: it reads the tourist's profile (interest category, number of days, daily budget) and displays it back to confirm what was understood.

### Step 4: Reason — Filter and Rank Matching Destinations
●	The agent compares every destination in its knowledge base against the tourist's goal: same category and cost per day within the daily budget.
●	If nothing fits the exact budget, it falls back to all destinations of the requested category, sorted from cheapest to costliest, so the agent always tries to return a useful plan.

### Step 5: Plan — Build a Day-wise Itinerary
●	The agent allocates up to 3 days per destination and moves to the next matching destination once those days are used, cycling back to the first if needed for longer trips.
●	Consecutive days at the same destination are merged into a single itinerary block, and the total estimated cost is calculated as it plans.

### Step 6: Act — Present the Recommendation to the Tourist
●	The act() function represents the agent's actuator: it prints a readable, day-wise itinerary with the destination, description, best season and cost for each leg of the trip, followed by the total estimated cost.

### Step 7: The Agent Loop — Perceive → Reason → Plan → Act
●	run_agent() ties the four stages together into a single agent cycle, exactly as a real autonomous agent continuously perceives, reasons and acts within its environment.

### Step 8: Test the Agent with Sample Tourist Profiles
●	Three realistic tourist profiles are used to test the agent across different interests and budgets: a budget heritage traveller, a mid-budget adventure seeker, and a family looking for a beach holiday.

### Output
Agent Output – Session 1 (Budget Heritage Traveller)
●	The agent correctly perceives Ananya's preferences, reasons that Taj Mahal and Jaipur are the matching heritage destinations within budget, and plans a 6-day itinerary split evenly between them.

Agent Output – Sessions 2 and 3 (Adventure Seeker and Beach Holiday)
●	For the adventure seeker, the agent plans a trip across Coorg and Spiti Valley, both within the Rs. 5,000/day budget.
●	For the beach-holiday family, the agent alternates between Goa and the Andaman Islands to fill all 7 requested days, and the total estimated cost is calculated automatically for each plan.

## Conclusion
Thus, a simple goal-based AI Tourist Agent for India was successfully designed, implemented and tested using Python. The agent follows the classic Perceive → Reason → Plan → Act cycle: it perceives a tourist's goal (interest, duration and budget), reasons over a knowledge base of Indian destinations to find matching options, plans a day-wise itinerary, and acts by presenting a complete, costed trip recommendation. This experiment demonstrates the core building blocks of autonomous agents — environment knowledge, perception, reasoning/planning and action — on which more advanced AI agents (using machine learning, real-time APIs and large language models) are built.
